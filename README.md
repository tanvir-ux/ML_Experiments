## Learning Experience
Here are some terms I found repeatedly in Machine Learning:
dot product, transpose, eigenvector, mean, std, variance, co-relation, co-variance,
sum, average, normalization, encoding, decoding, upsampling, downsampling, probability,
sampling, distribution, gaussian. 
Overall Linear Algebra, Statistics & Probability used repeatedly.

to be cont.
